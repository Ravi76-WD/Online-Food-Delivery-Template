# Online-Food-Delivery-Template
In this project,i have made a fully responsive webpage for an online food delivery system using HTML and CSS.

#Files used:

*index.html
*contact.html
*style.css

index.html: The following HTML code describes the structure of the webpage. First of all it has an header tag to 
display the name of the company which is “Online FoodShop”. The navigation bar contains tabs of “Home”, “About”, “Menu” and “ContactUs”. 
The navigation bar also consists of the logo of the company followed by the background image with some more details of the “Online FoodShop” along with the featured products.

contact.html: The following HTML code describes us what contents are present in the “ContactUs” tab in the navigation bar.
We have used input tags to enter the type of “query”, “name”, “email-id”, “phone number” and “explanation” of the query.
We have also used radio buttons to enquire about the customer’s membership for “online FoodShop “. The form also provides “Submit” and “Reset” buttons.

style.css: This is the stylesheet block which gives us the proper look of the webpage.

** Header styling: It consists of two “head” tags. We have used font-style “Ubuntu” to style the header and we also used proper colors to make some text look attractive.
** Navigation bar styling: It basically consists of logo styling and content styling. First of all we have considered the navigation bar as a flexbox and assigned the flex-direction to “column”. We have centered the logo image by display:block. We have used the margin:auto property to center the image. Then we considered the content of the navigation bar as a flexbox and then we have positioned it properly.
** Background image styling: We used before pseudo selectors to set the respective background images.
